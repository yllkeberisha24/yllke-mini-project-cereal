# Peer Review for Yllke Berisha (done by Sabira Onbayeva)

## Reproducibility report

I was able to clone the repository successfully and explore its structure in VS Code.  
The folder organization is clear, and the code is easy to locate.  

When I first ran the analysis using:
```bash
python code/analysis.py
```
I received an error:

```bash
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'output\\sugar_histogram.png'
```
This happened because the script saves the figure into a folder (output/) that does not exist by default.
After manually creating this folder with:
```bash
mkdir -p output
```
the script ran correctly and produced the expected histogram showing cereal sugar content.

Therefore:

- I could not reproduce the full result without changing anything.

- I could reproduce it after making one small change (creating the missing folder).

## Overall opinion

The project demonstrates a solid understanding of basic reproducibility principles and uses a clean, organized folder structure. The analysis itself is simple and clear. The code runs correctly once the folder issue is fixed, and the resulting figure provides a good visual summary of the data.

However, the documentation and environment setup could be more detailed to help users who are less familiar with Python or Conda.

I find the project description (README) a little minimal. It does not explain where the data came from, what it contains, or how many variables and observations it includes.

## Suggested improvements

1) Automatically create the output folder, so the project runs successfully on a clean system without manual folder creation.

2) Expand README documentation
- Some information about the project (goal, what the code does)
- A paragraph about the dataset (source, number of observations, variable descriptions, etc).
- Some more detailed instructions for users who are less familiar with the software
3) Keeping code and README consistent: The README mentions `output/figures/`, but the code saves the file to `output/`.
